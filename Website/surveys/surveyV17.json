Before the study begins, it is important that you learn about the procedure followed in this study and that you give your informed consent for voluntary participation. Please read this document carefully.</p><h4>Aim and Benefit of the Study</h4><p>Programming can be perceived as a “scary” and difficult task by new students, while having the ability to have computer fluency through programming can be a strong beneficial ability in this world. This research explores how different design roles, and the way in which they provide feedback, may influence the self-efficacy of students and their perceived difficulty of programming.</p><h4>Procedure</h4><p>The study lasts for roughly 15 minutes.</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p><ol><li>Reading this information brief + consent form</li><li>Signing consent (clicking a button)</li><li>Filling in a questionnaire on demographics of student and self-efficacy in programming</li><li>Run experiment: You will do a programming exercise, whilst receiving feedback</li><li>Filling in a closing questionnaire on self-efficacy and perceived difficulty once again</li></ol><p><em>Notice: The student may stop the study at any point in time.</em></p><h4>Risks</h4><p>The study does not involve any risks or detrimental side effects.</p><h4>Data Collection</h4><p>The study will collect the following data:</p><ul><li>Questionnaire and survey answers from opening survey</li><li>The feedback received during the exercise</li><li>Questionnaire answers from closing</li></ul><h4>Duration</h4><p>The data collected will be available on the researcher’s TUE OneDrive for a period of 6 months. After this the data will be deleted.</p><h4>Voluntary Participation</h4><p>Your participation is completely voluntary. You can refuse to participate without giving any reasons and you can stop your participation at any time during the study. You can also withdraw your permission to use your data up to 24 hours after the study is finished. All this will have no negative consequences whatsoever.</p><h4>Confidentiality</h4><p>For your information, this study involves data recording. Only the researcher will be able to view your data and they will be used only for scientific analysis.</p><p>The information that we collect from this study is also used for writing scientific publications and will mainly be reported at a quantitative level. It will be completely anonymous, and it cannot be traced back to you. Neither your name nor any other identifying information will be used in presentations or in written products resulting from the study without your written consent.</p><h4>Further Information</h4><p>If you want more information about this study, or want to withdraw from the study, please contact Jesse Strijker (email: <a href='mailto:j.j.strijker@student.tue.nl'>j.j.strijker@student.tue.nl</a>).</p><p>If you have any complaints about this study, please contact Regina Bernhaupt (email: <a href='mailto:r.bernhaupt@tue.nl'>r.bernhaupt@tue.nl</a>).</p><h4>Certificate of Consent</h4><p>I, have read and understood this consent form and have been given the opportunity to ask questions.</p><p>I have the following responsibilities: performing an exercise and participating in the questionnaires to the best of my ability.</p></section>"
